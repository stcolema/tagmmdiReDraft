\arguments{
\item{X}{Data to cluster. List of matrices with the N items to cluster held
in rows.}

\item{n_chains}{Integer. Number of MCMC chains to run.}

\item{R}{The number of iterations in the sampler.}

\item{thin}{The factor by which the samples generated are thinned, e.g. if
``thin=50`` only every 50th sample is kept.}

\item{initial_labels}{Initial clustering. $N x L$ matrix.}

\item{fixed}{Which items are fixed in their initial label. $N x L$ matrix.}

\item{alpha}{The concentration parameter for the stick-breaking prior and the
weights in the model.}

\item{initial_labels_as_intended}{Logical indicating if the passed initial 
labels are as intended or should ``generateInitialLabels`` be called.}

\item{type}{Character vector indicating density type to use. 'MVN'
(multivariate normal), 'TAGM' (t-adjust Gaussian mixture) or 'C' (categorical).}

\item{K_max}{Vector indicating the number of components to include (the upper
bound on the number of clusters in each dataset).}
}
\value{
A named list containing the sampled partitions, component weights and
phi parameters, model fit measures and some details on the model call.

of the same type and from the same initial clustering.

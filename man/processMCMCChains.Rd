\usage{
processMCMCChains(mcmc_lst, burn, point_estimate_method = "median")
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc_lst}{Output from ``runMCMCChains``}

\item{burn}{The number of MCMC samples to drop as part of a burn in.}
}
\value{
A named list similar to the output of
``runMCMCChains`` with some additional entries:
\describe{

 \item {``allocation_probability``} {$(N x K)$ matrix. The point estimate of
 the allocation probabilities for each data point to each class.}

 \item {``prob``} {$N$ vector. The point estimate of the probability of being
 allocated to the class with the highest probability.}

 \item {``pred``} {$N$ vector. The predicted class for each sample.}
 }
 @importFrom parallel parLapply
}
\description{
Applies a burn in to and finds a point estimate for each of the
chains outputted from ``runMCMCChains``.

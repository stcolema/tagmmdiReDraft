\title{Predict from multiple MCMC chains}
\usage{
predictFromMultipleChains(mcmc_outputs, burn, point_estimate_method = "median")
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc_outputs}{Output from ``runMCMCChains``}

\item{burn}{The number of MCMC samples to drop as part of a burn in.}

\item{point_estimate_method}{Summary statistic used to define the point
estimate. Must be ``'mean'`` or ``'median'``. ``'median'`` is the default.}
}
\value{
A named list of quantities related to prediction/clustering:

 * ``allocation_probability``: List with an $(N x K)$ matrix for each
   semi-supervised view. The point estimate of the allocation probabilities for
   each data point to each class.

 * ``prob``: List with an $N$ vector for each semi-supervised view. The point
   estimate of the probability of being allocated to the class with the
   highest probability.

 * ``pred``: List of $N$ vectorsfor each semi-supervised view. The predicted
   class for each sample.

 * ``allocations``: List of sampled allocations for each view. Columns
   correspond to items being clustered, rows to MCMC samples.
}
\description{
Applies a burn in to and finds a point estimate by combining
multiple chains of ``callMDI``.
